    <English>[TAB]Dyeing is the process of applying colors to fabrics. A human practice for over three thousand years, it enabled the natural white color of silk, wool and cotton to be enhanced with a varied spectrum of color. Natural dyes are created from a myriad of sources, including shells, animals and plants, though these dyes were not always permanent and frequently expensive. Modern dyes are based on artificial or processed substances such as coal and other chemicals. One benefit for a nation with an extensive dye industry is that the processes involved in creating dye can be easily retooled to other purposes. Germany discovered this in World War I when it was determined that factories producing artificial dye could be easily modified to create explosives, poison gas and other tools of war.</English>
    <French>[TAB]La teinture est le proc&#xE9;d&#xE9; de coloration des tissus. Cette pratique, vieille de plus trois mille ans, permet de donner de la couleur aux textiles blancs comme la soie, le coton ou la laine. Les teintures naturelles sont obtenues de multiples fa&#xE7;ons, que ce soit &#xE0; partir de coquillages, de plantes ou d'animaux. Mais ces teintures ne sont pas toujours permanentes et sont souvent ch&#xE8;res. Les colorants modernes sont &#xE0; base de produits synth&#xE9;tiques ou trait&#xE9;s, comme le charbon ou divers produits chimiques. Un pays poss&#xE9;dant une industrie des teintures florissante peut facilement adapter les proc&#xE9;d&#xE9;s de fabrication des teintures &#xE0; d'autres fins. L'Allemagne a ainsi d&#xE9;couvert au cours de la Premi&#xE8;re Guerre mondiale que les usines de fabrication de colorants artificiels pouvaient ais&#xE9;ment &#xEA;tre transform&#xE9;es pour cr&#xE9;er des explosifs, des poisons ou autres instruments de guerre.</French>
    <German>[TAB]Das F&#xE4;rben von Stoffen und Fasern geh&#xF6;rt schon seit mehr als drei Jahrtausenden zu den vom Menschen praktizierten Handwerken.

Nat&#xFC;rliche F&#xE4;rbemittel wurden aus unz&#xE4;hligen Quellen, einschlie&#xDF;lich Muscheln, Tieren und Pflanzen, gewonnen, obwohl diese nicht immer dauerhaft und meist auch teuer waren. Moderne F&#xE4;rbemittel basieren auf k&#xFC;nstlichen oder verarbeiteten Substanzen wie Kohle und anderen Chemikalien. Ein Land mit einer ausgedehnten F&#xE4;rbeindustrie hat den Vorteil, dass die zur Herstellung von F&#xE4;rbemitteln notwendigen Verfahren leicht f&#xFC;r andere Zwecke abgewandelt werden k&#xF6;nnen. W&#xE4;hrend des 1. Weltkrieges zeigte es sich in Deutschland, dass Fabriken, in denen k&#xFC;nstliche F&#xE4;rbemittel hergestellt wurden, kurzerhand so umstrukturiert werden konnten, dass sie stattdessen Sprengstoffe, giftiges Gas und anderes Kriegsmaterial produzierten.</German>

    <English>[TAB]The history of coffee begins in the 9th century. It is thought to have originated in the highlands of Ethiopia and spread to the rest of the world via Egypt and Europe. The word coffee is derived from the Arabic word Qah'wa, over Ottoman Turkish Kahve, which originally meant wine or other intoxicating liquors. Partly due to the Islamic prohibition on drinking alcohol, preparing and drinking coffee became an important social ritual. In the 15th century, Muslims introduced coffee in Persia, Egypt, northern Africa and Turkey, where the first cafeteria, Kiva Han, opened in 1475 in Constantinople. The stimulant effect of drinking coffee caused it to be forbidden among orthodox and conservative imams in Mecca in 1511 and in Cairo in 1532 by a theological court. In Egypt, coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee cherries were sacked. But the product's popularity, particularly among intellectuals, led to the reversal of this decision in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Selim I. From the Muslim world, coffee spread to Europe, where it became popular in the 17th century. Dutch traders were the first to start large scale import of coffee into Europe.</English>

The most important feature of the drydock is that once a ship is properly positioned within the dock, the water can be drained, allowing craftsmen to easily access the hull of the ship without first having to learn how to breathe water. While there is debate as to when the idea for the first drydock arose, the world's earliest working drydock was built by King Henry VIII in 1495. And while advances in technology would continue to improve the drydock over the next several hundred years, the concept remains unchanged since its colonial-era inception.</English>

    <German>Trockendocks sind kurze Kan&#xE4;le, die die Reparatur der Marine einer Kolonie stark vereinfachten. Die wichtigste Funktion eines Trockendocks besteht darin, dass, sobald ein Schiff sich in der richtigen Position befindet, das Wasser abgelassen werden kann, was es den Handwerkern erm&#xF6;glicht, die Schale des Schiffes ohne Tauchg&#xE4;nge leicht zu erreichen. Es ist zwar nicht gekl&#xE4;rt, wann die Idee eines Trockendocks entstanden ist, aber 1495 wurde das erste funktionsf&#xE4;hige Trockendock der Welt von K&#xF6;nig Heinrich VIII. erbaut. Und auch wenn durch technologische Fortschritte das Trockendock w&#xE4;hrend der n&#xE4;chsten Jahrhunderte verbessert werden konnte, ist das Prinzip seit der Kolonialzeit unver&#xE4;ndert geblieben.</German>

La pi&#xF9; importante caratteristica di un bacino di carenaggio &#xE8; che, una volta che una nave &#xE8; posizionata al suo interno, &#xE8; possibile farne uscire l'acqua. Ci&#xF2; permette agli artigiani di accedere con facilit&#xE0; allo scafo della nave senza dover prima imparare a respirare in acqua. La data di nascita dell'idea dei bacini di carenaggio &#xE8; argomento di discussione, ma il primo di questi venne costruito da Re Enrico VIII nel 1495. E mentre i progressi tecnologici avrebbero continuato a migliorare il bacino di carenaggio durante i secoli successivi, il concetto &#xE8; rimasto immutato fin dall'era coloniale.</Italian>
    <Spanish>Los Diques secos son peque&#xF1;os canales que permiten reparar f&#xE1;cilmente la flota de una colonia. La caracter&#xED;stica m&#xE1;s importante del Dique seco es que, una vez el barco est&#xE1; colocado adecuadamente en &#xE9;l, se puede drenar el agua, lo cual permite a los reparadores acceder f&#xE1;cilmente a su casco sin tener que aprender antes a respirar debajo del agua. Aunque se discute de d&#xF3;nde fue originaria la idea en s&#xED;, el primer Dique seco funcional del mundo fue construido por el rey Enrique VIII en 1495. Aunque los avances tecnol&#xF3;gicos continuar&#xED;an mejorando el Dique seco durante los siglos siguientes, el concepto sigue siendo pr&#xE1;cticamente el mismo que desde su introducci&#xF3;n en la era colonial.</Spanish>

    <Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_INDUSTRIAL_LUMBER_MILL_PEDIA</Tag>
    <English>The sheer abundance of lumber in North America made lumber mills one of the earliest industrialized buildings to be created in the colonies. Prior to the construction of the first lumber mills, it was often necessary to balance extremely long pieces of timber on the edges of pits or gulleys in order to properly prepare the wood, which proved to be a slow and dangerous process. [PARAGRAPH:1]Beginning in the 1640s, across the eastern coast of North America, rivers, creeks, and streams were dammed in order to power the many mills cropping up across the continent. In the American South, many plantations, because of their high demand for fresh timber, had their own lumber mills which could run nearly unmanned. This allowed the plantation's labor to focus on the collection of cotton or tobacco rather than sawing wood. </English>
    <French>En raison de l'abondance de bois en Am&#xE9;rique du Nord, les scieries feront partie des premiers b&#xE2;timents industriels cr&#xE9;&#xE9;s dans les colonies. Avant la construction des premi&#xE8;res scieries, il est souvent n&#xE9;cessaire d'&#xE9;quilibrer des troncs d'arbres extr&#xEA;mement longs sur les bords de fosses afin de pr&#xE9;parer convenablement le bois, ce qui s'av&#xE8;re extr&#xEA;mement long et dangereux. [PARAGRAPH:1]D&#xE8;s les ann&#xE9;es 1640, des barrages sont construits sur les cours d'eau de la c&#xF4;te est nord-am&#xE9;ricaine afin de faire fonctionner les nombreuses scieries qui apparaissent sur le continent. En raison de leurs importants besoins en bois de construction, beaucoup de plantations du Sud am&#xE9;ricain cr&#xE9;eront leurs propres scieries fonctionnant presque sans intervention humaine. Leur main-d'oeuvre pourra ainsi se concentrer sur la r&#xE9;colte du coton et du tabac, plut&#xF4;t que sur la coupe du bois.</French>
    <German>Der &#xFC;berfluss an Holz in Nordamerika sorgte daf&#xFC;r, dass S&#xE4;gewerke zu den fr&#xFC;hesten Industriegeb&#xE4;uden in den Kolonien geh&#xF6;rten. Vor dem Bau der ersten S&#xE4;gewerke war es h&#xE4;ufig notwendig, die sehr langen St&#xE4;mme auf Gruben zu balancieren, um das Holz entsprechend vorbereiten zu k&#xF6;nnen, was eine langsame und gef&#xE4;hrliche Methode war. [PARAGRAPH:1]Seit 1640 wurden die Fl&#xFC;sse, B&#xE4;che und Str&#xF6;me der Ostk&#xFC;ste Nordamerikas aufgestaut, um die vielen S&#xE4;gewerke anzutreiben, die &#xFC;berall aus dem Boden schossen. Im S&#xFC;den Amerikas hatten viele Plantagen wegen ihres hohen Holzbedarfs eigene S&#xE4;gewerke, die fast ohne menschliche Arbeitskraft auskamen. Dadurch konnten sich die Plantagenarbeiter auf das Sammeln von Baumwolle oder Tabak konzentrieren, anstatt auf das Verarbeiten von Holz.</German>
    <Italian>La grande abbondanza di legname in Nord America fece in modo che le segherie fossero uno dei primi edifici industrializzati a venire costruiti nelle colonie. Prima dell'arrivo delle segherie, spesso era necessario bilanciare tronchi estremamente lunghi sul bordo di fosse o canali, per riuscire a preparare correttamente il legno. Inutile dire che si trattava di un processo lento e pericoloso. [PARAGRAPH:1]A partire dagli anni 1640, sulla costa orientale del Nord America fiumi, torrenti e ruscelli vennero interrotti dalle dighe, per azionare le diverse segherie sorte sul continente. Negli Stati Uniti meridionali molte piantagioni, a causa della grossa richiesta di legname fresco, avevano le proprie segherie in grado di funzionare quasi senza assistenza umana. Ci&#xF2; permetteva ai lavoratori della piantagione di concentrarsi sulla raccolta del cotone e del tabacco, invece di segare il legname. </Italian>
    <Spanish>La gran abundancia de Madera en Am&#xE9;rica del Norte hizo de los Aserraderos uno de los edificios industriales de aparici&#xF3;n m&#xE1;s temprana en las colonias. Antes de que se construyeran los primeros de estos, sol&#xED;a ser necesario apoyar en precario equilibrio los largos trozos de madera en los bordes de hoyas o barrancos para poder prepararlos adecuadamente, lo cual demostr&#xF3; ser un procedimiento muy lento y peligroso. [PARAGRAPH:1]A principios de la d&#xE9;cada de 1640, por toda la costa este de Am&#xE9;rica del Norte se hicieron presas en r&#xED;os, riachuelos y arroyos para alimentar la gran cantidad de Aserraderos que brotaron. En Am&#xE9;rica del Sur, a causa de su gran necesidad de Madera, muchas plantaciones ya contaban con sus propios Aserraderos, que pod&#xED;an funcionar pr&#xE1;cticamente sin personal. Esto permiti&#xF3; que los trabajos de la plantaci&#xF3;n se concentraran en la recolecci&#xF3;n de Algod&#xF3;n o Tabaco, en vez de en aserrar Madera. </Spanish>

    <English>The "Cheval de frise" (plural: Chevaux de frise) was a Medieval defensive obstacle consisting of a portable frame (sometimes just a simple log) covered with many long iron or wooden spikes or even actual spears. They were principally intended as an anti-cavalry obstacle but could also be moved quickly to help block a breach in another barrier. They remained in occasional use until they were replaced by wire obstacles just after the American Civil War. During the Civil War, it was most often used by the Confederates.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Maya were a native Civilization in Central America, particularly known for their powerful empire and their highly developed culture. [PARAGRAPH:2] At the cenit of their power they truly formed a high culture. Although usually speaking of one Maya culture - in fact the different founding sites of their past showed many common aspects - there stand several people (sub-civlizations) behind this civilization all having or less closely realted dialects of the Mayan language. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Maya become famous for cultivation of corn, mathematics and their highly deveolped calender. Their writing - based on symbols and mostly deciphered today - is the most evolved - and until the arrival of the Spanish also the only - writing in Ancient America. Art (stone, ceramics, wood, textiles and paintings) was also very sophisticated. Some of their cities had step pyramides up to 65m, palasts, observatories, courts for ballgames and many other incredible architecural achievements. [PARAGRAPH:2] The classic Maya civilization was made of several city-states which each had their own ruler. These were connected by streets. Some of these city-states had more than 10.000 people, a very impressive number and bigger that any european city ofthat time. [PARAGRAPH:2] However, these city states were always rivaling and fighting for control of the trade routes. The political structures were very complex. There were inherited kingdomlike rulerships (sometimes also female rules), but also religious or aristocratic forms of leaderhsip.[PARAGRAPH:2] Already in the 9th century, some Maya centers were given up in the southern flatlands which lead to a rapidly shrinking population in the whole Yukatan area.

    <German>[TAB]Die Maya sind ein indigenes Volk bzw. eine Gruppe indigener V&#xF6;lker in Mittelamerika, die insbesondere aufgrund der von ihnen im Pr&#xE4;kolumbischen Mesoamerika gegr&#xFC;ndeten Reiche und ihrer hoch entwickelten Kultur bekannt sind.[PARAGRAPH:2]In ihrer Bl&#xFC;tezeit stellten sie eine m&#xE4;chtige Hochkultur dar. Man spricht zumeist von einer Maya-Kultur; tats&#xE4;chlich gibt es auch viele Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen den verschiedenen Fundstellen aus der Vergangenheit - doch stehen hinter dieser Kultur verschiedene V&#xF6;lker mit einander mehr oder weniger eng verwandten Maya-Sprachen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ber&#xFC;hmt sind die Maya f&#xFC;r den Anbau von Mais, ihre Mathematik und f&#xFC;r ihren hoch entwickelten Kalender, geschrieben in Hieroglyphen. Die mittlerweile weitgehend entzifferte Schrift basierte auf Bildsymbolen und stellte die h&#xF6;chstentwickelte (und bis zur Ankunft der Spanier einzige) Schrift in Altamerika dar. Kunsthandwerk, insbesondere die Bearbeitung von Stein, Keramik, Holz, Textilien, und die Malerei waren hoch entwickelt. Die Metallverarbeitung (Gold, Silber, Kupfer) spielte erst sp&#xE4;t und fast nur f&#xFC;r rituelle Zwecke eine Rolle. In den St&#xE4;dten gab es bis zu 65 m hohe Stufenpyramiden, Pal&#xE4;ste, Observatorien und Ballspielpl&#xE4;tze.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die klassische Maya-Zivilisation umfasste eine Reihe von Stadtstaaten, die jeweils einen eigenen Herrscher und ihm untergebene Verwalter hatte. Mit der Ausbreitung &#xFC;ber die ganze Yucatan-Halbinsel erreichte die Hochkultur der Maya ihre Bl&#xFC;tezeit. Viele St&#xE4;dte waren durch Dammstra&#xDF;en miteinander verbunden. Die St&#xE4;dte hatten teilweise mehr als 10.000 Einwohner und waren damit gr&#xF6;&#xDF;er als die gr&#xF6;&#xDF;ten St&#xE4;dte des damaligen Mitteleuropa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die einzelnen Stadtstaaten rivalisierten st&#xE4;ndig untereinander und rangen miteinander um die Kontrolle der Handelswege. Die politischen Strukturen waren sehr unterschiedlich. Neben erblichen K&#xF6;nigt&#xFC;mern, teilweise gef&#xFC;hrt von weiblichen Herrschern, gab es auch oligarchische und aristokratische Regierungsformen auf. Schlie&#xDF;lich entstanden St&#xE4;dteb&#xFC;nde, die an die antiken Handelsrepubliken Griechenlands erinnern.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bereits im 9. Jahrhundert kommt es zur Aufgabe einzelner Maya-Zentren im s&#xFC;dlichen Tiefland und in der Folgezeit zu einem rapiden Bev&#xF6;lkerungsverlust in der gesamten Zentralregion Yukatans. Zahlreiche St&#xE4;dte werden verlassen, die Bew&#xE4;sserungssysteme verfallen. Nach der Mitte des 10. Jahrhunderts werden im gesamten Tiefland keine monumentalen Steinbauten mehr errichtet. Ursachen des Niedergangs waren vermutlich die Verarmung der landwirtschaftlichen B&#xF6;den durch das rasche Bev&#xF6;lkerungswachstum und die milit&#xE4;rische Bedrohung durch andere V&#xF6;lker wie die Tolteken.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Hernan Cortes 1519 auf Yucatan ankam, halfen die Maya zwischenzeitlich den spanischen Konquistadoren, ihre Nachbarv&#xF6;lker zu unterwerfen, um an ihnen f&#xFC;r vorangegangene Kriege Rache zu nehmen. Doch sie zahlten daf&#xFC;r einen hohen Preis: Die Spanier dominierten bald die gesamte Region, und die Maya verloren auch noch die Reste ihrer politischen Macht.</German>

    <German>[TAB]Die Tehuelche waren eine Gruppe von St&#xE4;mmen aus Patagonien in S&#xFC;damerika. Sie lebten nomadisch in den Steppen zwischen der Stra&#xDF;e von Magellan im S&#xFC;den und dem Rio Negro im Norden. Der Namen "Tehuelche" wurde ihnen von den benachbarten Mapuche-Indianern gegeben und von den Spaniern &#xFC;bernommen, er bedeutet soviel wie grimmige, heftige und gro&#xDF;e Leute. Sich selbst bezeichneten sie als Ahonicanka oder Tchonek, was schlicht "Mensch" bedeutet. Die Tehuleche lassen sich in eine s&#xFC;dliche und eine n&#xF6;rdliche Gruppe einteilen, welche sich durch ihren Dialekt und geringf&#xFC;gig andere k&#xF6;rperliche Merkmale unterschieden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Patagonien und die Gebiete n&#xF6;rdlich davon sind seit ca. 12 500 Jahren von Menschen besiedelt. &#xFC;ber die Urspr&#xFC;nge dieser Ureinwohner ist sehr wenig bekannt. Zum ersten Kontakt zwischen Europ&#xE4;ern und den Tehuelche kam es, als Ferdinand Magellan die K&#xFC;ste 1520 erkundete. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Beschreibungen von Antonio Pigaffeta, dem Chronisten von Magellans Reise,  pr&#xE4;gten das f&#xFC;r Jahrhunderte in Europa verbreitete Bild eines Volkes von Riesen. Angeblich h&#xE4;tten die europ&#xE4;ischen Seefahrern den Einheimischen kaum bis an die H&#xFC;fte gereicht. Zwar waren diese Angaben ma&#xDF;los &#xFC;bertrieben, gro&#xDF;e k&#xF6;rperliche Kraft und Ausdauer sowie besonders der hoher Wuchs (h&#xE4;ufig &#xFC;ber 1,80 m bei den M&#xE4;nnern) zeichneten sie jedoch gegen&#xFC;ber den anderen Ureinwohnern aus, die die Europ&#xE4;er bis dato kannten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Nomaden lebten sie vorrangig von der Jagd auf V&#xF6;gel, Guanakos und Kleinwild sowie dem Sammeln von Wurzeln und essbaren Pflanzen. Ihre Wanderungen folgten den Beutetieren und den Jahreszeiten, im Sommer entlang von Fl&#xFC;ssen und Seen im Inland, im Winter entlang der K&#xFC;ste. [PARAGRAPH:2]F&#xFC;r die Jagd wurden urspr&#xFC;nglich vor allem kurze B&#xF6;gen und Feuersteinger&#xE4;t genutzt, sp&#xE4;ter wurde die auch anderen indigenen V&#xF6;lkern bekannte Bola - eine Fangwurfleine mit 1-3 Gewichten - zur Hauptwaffe. In Auseinandersetzungen Mann gegen Mann kamen auch &#xFC;ber f&#xFC;nf Meter lange Lanzen zum Einsatz. Ackerbau war ihnen unbekannt und in den von starken Winden, Wassermangel und harten Wintern gepr&#xE4;gten Gebieten auch kaum m&#xF6;glich. Charles Darwin schrieb w&#xE4;hrend seiner Reise entlang der K&#xFC;ste zu Patagonien nur: "Der Fluch der Unfruchtbarkeit liegt &#xFC;ber diesem Land."[PARAGRAPH:2]Im 18. Jahrhundert z&#xE4;hmten vor allem die n&#xF6;rdlichen St&#xE4;mme verwilderte Pferde, die von den Europ&#xE4;ern nach Amerika gebracht worden waren. Die Reichweite ihres nomadischen Lebensstils erh&#xF6;hte sich so betr&#xE4;chtlich, auch der Handel mit weiter entfernten Partnern gewann stark an Bedeutung. Die einzelnen Gruppen erreichten bald eine Gr&#xF6;&#xDF;e von bis zu 500 Stammesangeh&#xF6;rigen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Gegensatz zu anderen Ureinwohnern Amerikas wurden die Tehuelche nicht von den Kolonialm&#xE4;chten unterworfen oder ausgerottet, wenn auch Alkohol und eingeschleppte Krankheiten ihren Tribut forderten. Ein Teil von ihnen wurde im Zuge der so genannten "Araukanisierung" assimiliert. Diese Entwicklung im ganzen S&#xFC;den S&#xFC;damerikas bezeichnet das Vordringen der Mapuche-Kultur, deren Sprache und Einfluss zu dieser Zeit viele andere indigene Gruppen pr&#xE4;gte. Handel, Heirat und Krieg gingen dabei Hand in Hand. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der andere Teil wurde im 19. Jahrhundert - wie letztendlich auch die Mapuche -  mit Milit&#xE4;rgewalt von den jungen Nationalstaaten Chile und Argentinien zwangsintegriert. Bis dahin sch&#xFC;tzte die Tehuelche vor allem die Unwirtlichkeit ihres Landes und das daraus resultierende geringe Interesse anderer. Schwelende territoriale Konflikte zwischen Chile und Argentinien sowie der erfolgreiche Beginn von Schafzucht beendeten jedoch diese Isolation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In den 1870er Jahren begann unter dem sp&#xE4;teren argentinischen Pr&#xE4;sidenten Julio Roca die sogenannte W&#xFC;stenkampagne, "W&#xFC;ste" bezeichnet in diesem Zusammenhang eher das Denken der Eroberer, im Sinne von ungenutzt, brachliegend und kulturlos. Mit milit&#xE4;rischer Gewalt wurden die Gebiete bis zur Stra&#xDF;e von Magellan erobert, organisierte erfolgreiche Gegenwehr konnte von den Tehuelche nicht geleistet werden. Heutige Historiker werten die Ereignisse w&#xE4;hrend der Kampagne als V&#xF6;lkermord.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die &#xFC;berlebenden Tehuelche wurden in Reservaten angesiedelt, der sesshafte Lebensstil, Krankheiten und Alkohol dezimierten sie rasch. Die  Nachkommen der Tehuelche leben noch heute, oft als Gauchos, in Argentinien, ihre alten Stammesgebiete werden gr&#xF6;&#xDF;tenteils zur Schaf- und Ziegenzucht genutzt.</German>

    <German>Die Shuar sind ein Volk, das zur Zeit der europ&#xE4;ischen Entdeckung Amerikas in den Regenw&#xE4;ldern der s&#xFC;damerikanischen Kordilleren lebte, in den nordwestlichen H&#xF6;henlagen des Amazonasbeckens.[PARAGRAPH:2]Urspr&#xFC;nglich geh&#xF6;rten die Shuar wohl zum Volk der Palta und siedelten westseits der Anden am Pazifik. Doch unter den Angriffen des m&#xE4;chtigen Inkareiches zerstreute sich ihr Heimatvolk, und die Shuar flohen ostw&#xE4;rts &#xFC;ber die P&#xE4;sse des Hochgebirges und stiegen hinab in den Regenwald. Dort lebten sie zun&#xE4;chst wieder unbedr&#xE4;ngt, bauten S&#xFC;&#xDF;kartoffeln, Maniok und Erdn&#xFC;sse an, fischten in den Urwaldfl&#xFC;ssen und sammelten an den Ufern Fr&#xFC;chte und Insekten. Mit fremden St&#xE4;mmen gerieten sie hin und wieder in blutige Fehden. Aus den abgetrennten H&#xE4;uptern ihrer Feinde fertigten sie Schrumpfk&#xF6;pfe, im Glauben, die darin gefangenen Seelen ihrer Gegner w&#xFC;rden ihnen St&#xE4;rke verleihen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts wurden die Shuar von neuen und m&#xE4;chtigen Feinden behelligt. Spanische Konquistadoren drangen in das Amazonasbecken ein, errichteten befestigte Siedlungen und erkl&#xE4;rten die Heimat der Shuar zum Herrschaftsbereich des spanischen Gouverneurs. Doch die Shuar setzten sich bald erbittert zur Wehr und schlugen die Eroberer blutig zur&#xFC;ck. 1599 machten sie zwei St&#xE4;dte der Spanier dem Erdboden gleich und richteten ihren Gouverneur hin. Daraufhin gaben es die Spanier auf, das Land der Shuar kolonisieren zu wollen, zogen sich in die K&#xFC;stenregionen zur&#xFC;ck und brachen alle Kontakte ab. Unter den Europ&#xE4;ern geisterten bald schaurige Legenden &#xFC;ber die Shuar, die grausamen, Furcht einfl&#xF6;&#xDF;enden Barbaren, die den frommen Christenmenschen K&#xF6;pfe und Seelen raubten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Erst Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts gelang es Jesuiten, im Gebiet der Shuar dauerhaft Missionsstationen zu errichten. Verarmte, landlose Ecuadorianer kamen aus dem Andenhochland als Siedler herab in den Regenwald und schafften es, mit den gef&#xFC;rchteten Ureinwohnern friedliche Handelsbeziehungen aufzunehmen. Die Shuar &#xFC;berlie&#xDF;en den Fremden ihr Land im Tausch gegen G&#xFC;ter und schickten ihre Kinder auf die Missionsschulen. Heute leben in Ecuador noch etwa 50.000 bis 100.000 Shuar.</German>

    <English>[TAB]The Huron, who are also known as the Wyandot, originally inhabited the area of central Ontario. Little is known of the history of the Huron's before the arrival of the French upon the shores of the St. Lawrence in 1535. [PARAGRAPH:1] Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the Huron may of numbered as many as 40,000 people. French estimates of the four core tribes that made up the Huron Confederacy in 1615 numbered the Huron population from 20,000 -30,000 spread throughout 16-25 villages. However, European contact proved devastating for the Huron, and by 1640 successive epidemics and wars had reduced their number to less than 10,000.

    <German>[TAB]Die Huronen (oder Wyandot oder Wendat - f&#xFC;r die Zeit bis um 1700 ist die vom franz&#xF6;sischen hurons abgeleitete Bezeichnung Huronen gel&#xE4;ufig) waren, als die ersten Europ&#xE4;er im 16. Jahrhundert mit ihnen Kontakt aufnahmen, eine Konf&#xF6;deration von f&#xFC;nf indianischen Ethnien. Sie sprachen eine der irokesischen Sprachen. Zu den Wyandot z&#xE4;hlten etwa 30.000 Menschen, doch durch Pockenepidemien und die Biberkriege (1640-1701) brach die Bev&#xF6;lkerungszahl zusammen - in Kanada bis 1760 auf etwa hundert Menschen. Andere, ebenfalls versprengte Gruppen schlossen sich Wyandotgruppen an, doch mussten diese s&#xFC;dlicheren Gruppen innerhalb der USA westw&#xE4;rts ziehen. [PARAGRAPH:1] Urspr&#xFC;nglich waren die Wyandot Teil des irokesischen Volkes, trennten sich aber von diesem und verb&#xFC;ndeten sich mit Algonkin-V&#xF6;lkern. Wie die Irokesen lebten sie in Langh&#xE4;usern und betrieben Landwirtschaft. Gegen 1300 schlossen sich mehrere Clans zusammen und bildeten die Attignawantan (Attignousntan), die innerhalb der sich bildenden Wyandot-Konf&#xF6;deration der beherrschende und gr&#xF6;&#xDF;te Stamm werden sollten. Um 1420 schlossen sich diesen die Attingneenangnahoc an, und diese beiden St&#xE4;mme gr&#xFC;ndeten die Wyandot-Konf&#xF6;deration. Als Hauptstadt wurde Ossossane gew&#xE4;hlt, die gr&#xF6;&#xDF;te Siedlung der Attignawantan. Mit der Verbreitung und dem teilweisen Abzug der Sankt-Lorenz-Irokesen aus dem &#xF6;stlichen Ontario schlossen sich 1560 die Arendahronon sowie 1570 die Tahontaenrat (Tohonaenrat) der Konf&#xF6;deration an. Jeder Stamm sandte Repr&#xE4;sentanten zum gemeinsamen Rat in Ossossane, in dem &#xFC;ber Krieg und Frieden, B&#xFC;ndnisse sowie Handel und Jagd beraten wurde. Auf dem H&#xF6;hepunkt ihrer Macht geh&#xF6;rten dem Rat der Wyandot etwa 52 Mitglieder an. [PARAGRAPH:1] Bald nach Ankunft der Franzosen, ihren langj&#xE4;hrigen Verb&#xFC;ndeten, erlangten sie eine beherrschende Stellung im Fellhandel. Doch die Franzosen hatten sich hierdurch die m&#xE4;chtige Irokesen-Liga zum Feind gemacht, die sich im Covenant Chain mit den Engl&#xE4;ndern verb&#xFC;ndeten und von diesen (wie zuvor von den Niederl&#xE4;ndern) mit Waffen versorgt wurden. Dies gab den zahlenm&#xE4;&#xDF;ig schw&#xE4;cheren Irokesen eine enorme milit&#xE4;rische Schlagkraft gegen&#xFC;ber den sie umgebenden St&#xE4;mmen, zumal die Wyandot 1639 schwer von einer Pockenepidemie getroffen wurden. Besonders die Mohawk stiegen durch diese K&#xE4;mpfe zu den wichtigsten Handelspartnern der Briten am Hudson River auf und bekriegten fortan die s&#xFC;dlichen Verb&#xFC;ndeten der Wyandot, die Susquehannock. Langsam wurden die Susquehannock durch die Attacken der Mohawk und Oneida immer mehr aufgerieben und geschw&#xE4;cht. Die Huronen ihrerseits lie&#xDF;en sich, nachdem die Engl&#xE4;nder 1629 Quebec erobert hatten (bis 1632) durch Jean Nicolet f&#xFC;r einen Boykott der Engl&#xE4;nder gewinnen.</German>

Stets in Sorge, dass die Iroquesen letztlich die vollst&#xE4;ndige Ausl&#xF6;schung seines Stammes wieder vorantreiben k&#xF6;nnten, nutzte Kondiaronk eine Kombination aus &#xFC;berredung und Gewalt um die St&#xE4;mme der Oberen Seen zu vereinen um damit zu verhindern, dass diese eigene Friedensabkommen mit den Iroquesen schliessen w&#xFC;rden. [PARAGRAPH:1] Mit dem Ziel einen separaten Frieden zwischen Franzosen und Iroquesen zu verhindern, &#xFC;berfiel er 1688 iroquesische Abgesandte auf einer Strecke in der N&#xE4;he des heutigen Oswego und zog sich damit den Unmut des Gouvernuer Generals von Neu Frankreich zu.

It was with Orkeke and his people that George Charles Musters made his celebrated trip of Patagonia, and recorded his exploits in the classic "At home with the Patagonians." [PARAGRAPH:1] By the early 1880's most of the Chonkeh's tribal land had been confiscated and encroached upon and their population had dwindled to just over fifty people. In the Winter of 1883, Orkeke and his people were taken into custody by the Argentine government, allegedly for their involvement in a clash between Argentine troops and a combined force of Araunco and Chonkeh warriors on the plains of Apeleg in the Andean Chubut. Orkeke and his people were allowed limited freedom, treated to the sights of Buenos Aires and a non-stop series of social events, including an audience with General Roca, the Argentine president.

Gemeinsam mit Unterh&#xE4;uptlingen entschieden sie &#xFC;ber die Routen, die Lagerpl&#xE4;tze sowie Beginn und Ende der Jagd. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Kazike Orkeke, Sohn eines gleichnamigen H&#xE4;uptlings, erlangte regionale Ber&#xFC;hmtheit durch das Schicksal, welches ihm und seinen Leuten aufgezwungen wurde. Bereits im 18. Jahrhundert taucht sein Stamm in europ&#xE4;ischen Berichten auf. 1869 verbrachte der englische Offizier George Musters ein Jahr der Wanderschaft mit Orkeke und seinen Stammesangeh&#xF6;rigen. In dieser Zeit wurde er dessen Freund und Vertrauter und erwarb umfangreiche Kenntnis &#xFC;ber die Tehuelche. In seinem Bericht "At home with the Patagonians" beschreibt er den zu dieser Zeit schon &#xFC;ber 60 Jahre alten H&#xE4;uptling als sehr gro&#xDF; und muskul&#xF6;s, dabei aber agil und ausdauernd wie ein halb so alter Mann, mit dichtem schwarzen Haar, das nur von wenigen grauen Str&#xE4;hnen durchbrochen wurde. Die hohe Stirn, seine ebenm&#xE4;&#xDF;igen Gesichtsz&#xFC;ge und die ernsten Augen gaben ihm ein intellektuelles aussehen. Musters betont den gro&#xDF;z&#xFC;gigen, ehrlichen, aber stets besorgten Geist des Kaziken.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jedoch scheint auch Musters wenig &#xFC;ber das fr&#xFC;he Leben Orkekes erfahren zu haben, er berichtet lediglich, dass dieser in jungen Jahren von einem verfeindeten Stamm gefangen genommen wurde. Ihm gelang verletzt die Flucht zu seinen Leuten, sonst h&#xE4;tte ihn ein Leben in Sklaverei erwartet.[PARAGRAPH:2]In den 1870er Jahren erh&#xE4;lt Orkeke finanzielle Unterst&#xFC;tzung vom argentinischen Staat daf&#xFC;r, dass er seinen Stamm unter argentinischer Flagge f&#xFC;hrt, da Chile die Region ebenfalls beansprucht. Nach Beilegung der Grenzstreitigkeiten wird er zusammen mit seiner Frau und seinen Leuten 1883 in Schutzhaft, so der offizielle Ausdruck, genommen. Hintergrund sind Erhebungen einiger Mapuche und Tehuelche St&#xE4;mme gegen die Willk&#xFC;r der argentinischen Milit&#xE4;rs. Bei dem so genannten Apeleg-Zwischenfall  waren zuvor zwei Soldaten und an die achtzig Ureinwohner get&#xF6;tet worden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Tehuelche werden nach Buenos Aires verschifft und dort Anfang August in einer Kaserne festgehalten. Nach einiger Zeit lockert man die Auflagen und beginnt Orkeke und sein Gefolge &#xF6;ffentlich zu pr&#xE4;sentieren. Er wird in Theatervorf&#xFC;hrungen und zu anderen gesellschaftlichen Anl&#xE4;ssen geladen, trifft den argentinischen Pr&#xE4;sidenten Julio Roca und erregt durch seine K&#xF6;rpergr&#xF6;&#xDF;e und seine stolze Erscheinung viel Aufsehen bei den Einwohnern und in der Presse.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im September 1883 erkrankt er an einer Lungenentz&#xFC;ndung. Im Krankenhaus lehnt er jedwede Behandlung durch &#xE4;rzte ab. Die Heilerin des Stammes war zuvor bereits verstorben, auch fehlten die den Tehuelche vertrauten Kr&#xE4;uter in der Stadt. Am 12. 09. 1883 stirbt er. Sein Leichnam wird darauf in Lauge eingelegt, um sein imposantes Skelett f&#xFC;r museale Zwecke zu gewinnen - als ethnologisches Schaust&#xFC;ck. Bei einer sp&#xE4;teren &#xFC;berf&#xFC;hrung gehen seine &#xFC;berreste jedoch verloren und sind bis heute nicht wieder gefunden worden. Weitere Angeh&#xF6;rige seines Stammes, darunter seine Frau, sterben ebenfalls an Lungenentz&#xFC;ndung, bis die Regierung die &#xFC;berlebenden zur&#xFC;ck in ihre Heimat verschifft.</German>

Henry encouraged his father to conquer Ceuta (1415), the Muslim port on the North African coast across the Straits of Gibraltar from the Iberian peninsula, with profound consequences on Henry's worldview: Henry became aware of the profit possibilities in the Saharan trade routes that terminated there and became fascinated with Africa in general; he was most intrigued by the Christian legend of Prester John and the expansion of Portuguese trade.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is a common conception that Henry gathered at his Vila on the Sagres peninsula a school of navigators and map-makers. He did employ some cartographers to help him chart the coast of Mauritania in the wake of voyages he sent there, but for the rest there was no center of navigational science or any supposed observatory in the modern sense of the word, nor was there an organized navigational center. In "Cr&#xF3;nica da Guin&#xE9;" Henry is described as a person with no luxuries, not avaricious, speaking with soft words and calm gestures, a man of many virtues that never allowed any poor person leave his presence empty handed.</English>

    <English>[TAB] The name Italy (Italia) is an ancient name for the country and people of Southern Italy. Its origin is unclear, but could be Greek for "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". Coins bearing the name Italia were minted by an alliance of Italic tribes (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and other) competing with Rome in the first century B.C. By the time of emperor Augustus approximately, the multi-ethnic territory of Italy was included in Italia as the central unit of the Empire; Cisalpine Gaul, the Upper Po valley, for example was appended in 42 B.C. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Lombard invasions, "Italy" or "Italian" gradually became the collective name for diverse states appearing on the peninsula and their overseas properties. [PARAGRAPH:2] Italy became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification. The Vatican is now an independent enclave surrounded by Italy, as is San Marino. [PARAGRAPH:2] The Fascist government of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to the alliance with Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately Italy's defeat in World War II. The Allied Powers invaded Sicily in 1943, and gradually made their way north through the mainland.

    <English>Agile and maneuverable, the caravel was a small sailing ship with three or four masts, a broad bow, and a high, narrow stern. Though often used as a light warship, the caravel could also carry just over 100 metric tons of cargo. The Spanish and the Portuguese used caravels for both commerce and exploration. Christopher Columbus' three ships, the "Nina," "Pinta," and "Santa Maria," were caravels that risked the hazards of an ocean crossing.</English>

The Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are also part of Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:2]The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since prehistoric times. Some of the earliest civilizations include Lusitanians and Celtic societies. Incorporation into the Roman Republic dominions took place in the 2nd century BC.

The Aztecs destroyed the Zapotec capital cities of Mitla and Zaachila-Yoo, but ultimately were driven out of the region of Tehuantepec, by a Zapotec-Mixtec force under the brilliant generalship of the Zapotec king, Cocijoeza. Under a peace treaty with the Aztecs and Mixtecs, the Zapotecs managed to maintain political autonomy for the next 25 years.[PARAGRAPH:1] Hostilities between Zapotecs and Mixtecs broke out again in 1519, but were interrupted by the arrival of the Spanish. With the fall of the Aztec empire, the Zapotecs pledged allegiance to Cortez, and helped the Spanish defeat the Mixtecs. The Zapotec in turn were conquered by the Spanish in several campaigns from 1522-27.</Spanish>

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Carib's ever ate human flesh to satisfy hunger.[PARAGRAPH:1] The 'Black Carib's of St. Vincent and Dominica, known as Garifuna, were descended from slaves who had escaped or had been marooned from shipwrecks. They intermarried with the Carib, and their resistance delayed the settlement of Dominica by the British. In 1795 the Garifuna were transported to Roatan Island off of Honduras. Their descendents continue to live there. By the end of the 18th century, the Carib's had been driven from almost all of the islands they had once inhabited suffering great loss of life either through fatalities to disease, or through warfare with European settlers. The last known speakers of Island Carib died in the 1920s, and the language is now considered extinct.</Spanish>

Die Algonquian, die den Ohio &#xFC;berschritten, bildeten eine lose Konf&#xF6;dertaion mit anderen St&#xE4;mmen die nach Westen vertrieben wurden und alliierten sich zuerst mit den Franzosen und sp&#xE4;ter mit den Engl&#xE4;ndern in der Hoffnung so ihr Territorium for weiterer Besiedelung durch den Weissen Mann zu sch&#xFC;tzen. Die St&#xE4;mme im Ohio Tal hielten ihren Wiederstand bis nach der Revolution aufrecht, wurden aber letztlich im Northwest Indian War in den Jahren 1785-95 besiegt. Der Vertrag von Greenville 1795 besiegelte die Aufgabe aller L&#xE4;nder westlich des Ohio. Tecumseh versuchte den indianischen Wiederstand 1811 wiederzubeleben, aber sein Tod 1813 beendete alle Opposition der Algonquian. In den n&#xE4;chsten 30 Jahren unterzeichneten die Algonquian eine Reihe von Vertr&#xE4;gen, die schrittweise zur Abtretung der meisten verbliebenen Territorien und zur Zur&#xFC;ckdr&#xE4;ngung westlich des Mississippi f&#xFC;hrten.</German>

    <Spanish>[TAB]The term Mixtec comes from the Nahuatl word mixtecah, meaning cloud people. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Mixtec were one of the most prominent civilizations in Mesoamerica, known for their proficient buildings, a renowned knowledge of astronomy, and being one of the finest goldsmiths in the Americas. Migrating into the Oaxaca valley, the Mixtec came into contact with the aged Zapotec civilization, rebuilding many abandoned Zapotec cities. In a long and sporadic war the Mixtec gradually wrestled control of the Oaxaca valley from the Zapotec. However, their conquest of the Central Valleys was interrupted in the 14th and 15th centuries by the emergence and increasing dominance of the Aztecs.

She was also known as Lady Six Monkey, which refers to her day of birth within the 260-day Aztec calendar, which cycled through 13 numbers and 20 various signs. Lady Six Monkey became heir of Xaltepec after a dynastic struggle for power, which resulted in the deaths of several elder siblings. The crisis impelled her to seek guidance from the priestess of the Death Cave (Huahi Cahi) in Chalcatongo. The priestess, Lady Nine Grass, instructed her to marry Lord Eleven Wind, heir to the Xipe Bundle, a marriage which would secure both of their monarchial claims. On the way to her husband's town, her party passed through the settlements of Mountain of the Moon and Mountain of the Insect (probably Yucu Yoo-Tiyuqh). There her ambassadors were insulted with the words "knife, knife," which in Mixtec usually meant a curse or threat. Lady Six Monkey used these words as a pretext for declaring war and launched an attack, leaving both settlements in flames. She captured the offending princes and sacrificed them.

    <English>[TAB]The Comanche emerged as a separate group shortly before 1700, when they parted from the Shoshone people. This separation occurred at the same time the Comanche acquired the horse from the Pueblo Indians, which then enabled them to expand their search for new hunting grounds. The Comanche migration took them to the southern great plains, which the Comanche named Comancheria, a territory that extended from the present day Arkansas River to central Texas.  During this migration the Comanche's population significantly increased largely due to ample food in the form of buffalo, the arrival of Shoshone migrants and the adoption of captive women and children from other tribes. [PARAGRAPH:1]Despite their increased numbers the Comanche never formed a single cohesive people, but rather a dozen separate and autonomous tribes. Horses became a key factor in the emergence of the Comanche culture, and the Comanche may have been the first group of plains Indians to fully incorporate the horse into their culture. The Comanche had access to vast numbers of horses, which were estimated to have numbered close to 2,000,000 in and around Comancheria. The Comanche possessed 40,000 horses, with a surplus of 90,000 to 120,000 horses and by the mid-19th century they were supplying horses to French and American traders and settlers. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Comanche maintained strained relations with European and later American settlers who attempted to settle within the borders of their territory, being simultaneously valued trading partners and feared as fierce opponents. Warfare was a part of Comanche life, and they adapted many strategies for fighting on horseback, especially mounted raids, which inevitably led to the Comanche at one time or another being at war with almost every other tribe on the great plains. Throughout the 1860's the Comanche continued to fight against United States forces, but by 1875, with their Buffalo herds decimated and their own numbers reduced from disease and war, the last Comanche bands surrendered and moved onto reservations.</English>

The Comanche had access to vast numbers of horses, which were estimated to have numbered close to 2,000,000 in and around Comancheria.

Warfare was a part of Comanche life, and they adapted many strategies for fighting on horseback, especially mounted raids, which inevitably led to the Comanche at one time or another being at war with almost every other tribe on the great plains.

    <German>[TAB]Die Comanchen erschienen als eigenst&#xE4;ndiger Stamm kurz vor 1700, als sie sich vom Volk der Shoshonen l&#xF6;sten. Diese Abspaltung geschah zur selben Zeit, als sie von den Pueblo Indianern Pferde erwarben, was ihnen erm&#xF6;glichte ihre Jagdgebiete stark auszuweiten. Die Migration der Comanchen f&#xFC;hrte sie zu den s&#xFC;dlichen Great Plains, die die Comanchen Comancheria nannten, ein Gebiet, dass sich vom heutigen Arkansas Fluss bis in das zentrale Texas erstreckte. W&#xE4;hrend der Migration wuchs die Bev&#xF6;lerkung der Comanchen signifikant aufgrund des reichen Nahrungsvorkommens in Form von B&#xFC;ffeln, die Ankunft von weiteren Shoshone Migranten, und die Aufnahme von geraubten Kindern und Frauen aus anderen St&#xE4;mmen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz ihrer stark gewachsenen Zahl bildeten die Comanchen nie ein geeintes Volk, sondern blieben stets ein Dutzend eigenst&#xE4;ndige St&#xE4;mme.

Die Zahl der Pferde in der Comancheria zu dieser Zeit wird auf 2 Millionen gesch&#xE4;tzt. Mitte des 19ten Jahrhunderts verkaufeten sie Pferde and franz&#xF6;sische und amerikansiche H&#xE4;ndler. [PARAGRAPH:1] Die Beziehungen der Comachen zu den Europ&#xE4;ern und sp&#xE4;ter zu den Amerikanern, die in ihrem Gebiet zu siedeln versuchten, blieben angespannt, da diese gleichzeitig gesch&#xE4;tzte Handelspartner aber auch Gegner in Bezug auf die territorialen Rechte waren. Krieg war Teil des normalen Lebens der Comanchen und sie entwickelten viele Strategien um auf Pferden zu k&#xE4;mpfen, wie berittene &#xFC;berf&#xE4;lle, die unausweichlich dazu f&#xFC;hrten, dass sich die Comachen mit fast jedem anderen Stamm in den Great Plains im Krieg befanden. In den 1860ern k&#xE4;mpften die Comachen gegen die Truppen der United States. Als aber um 1875, die B&#xFC;ffelherden dezimiert wurden und ihre Bev&#xF6;lkerung durch Krankheiten und Kriege geschw&#xE4;cht war, ergaben sich die letzten Comanche und zogen sichin Reservate zur&#xFC;ck.</German>

However, his jacket failed to protect him from the Buffalo gun of the Tonkawa Indian Jim Pockmark, who shot and killed the Comanche chief.
