- Removed dialog that asks for confirmation for declaration of war when entering a native village if the unit in question is a transport
- Natives will not teach skills if they are still angry due to bargaining
- If a size 1 city is razed, the player no longer gets an annoying and redundant message stating that the city will be abandoned
- Corrected artillery unit texture scaling issue in Europe. Removed the code for the other ports since it is not needed
- The great tool factory will correctly reduce the food yields of the city 
- The graduation of colonists will no longer be able to cause a CTD (was only an issue when English text was used)
- Attempting to assign a unit that produces nothing on a plot (noble, governor etc.) no longer causes a CTD
- Fix swapped import / export limit parameters

Events:

Map generator:

- Indian villages will no longer be placed on top of bonus resources.

AI:

- Fix AI handling of professions with multiple input yields
- AI players can now travel to the African port to sell goods/treasure and buy slaves.
- AI now sort the units that wait on the European docks by their value. This ensures that the most valuable units get picked up first.
- Prevent AI transport ships from traveling to Europe if they are carrying at least one unit. The AI should prioritize putting its units to work in the new world and not keep ferrying the same unit(s) back and forth, wasting turns and transport capacity.
- Great generals will now only consider safe paths when relocating between cities. This avoids previously reported issues in which a GG would travel through (or close to) enemy territory
- AI will now prioritize the production of liberty bells
- AI will produce the yields that gives the best profit, either in Europe or Africa.
- AI will no longer overproduce certain yields (ore)
- AI is more likely to produce yields that are used as input for other goods.
- The value of Bells/hammers now scale with the population / rebel percentage.
- AI may choose to go to Africa rather than Europe if to maximize the sale profit
- AI can now use great admirals
- AI will use their starting units better
