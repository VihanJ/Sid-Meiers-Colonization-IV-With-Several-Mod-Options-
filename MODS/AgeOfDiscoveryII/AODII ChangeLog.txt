[SIZE=4][b]Welcome to the Age of Discovery II![/b][/SIZE]

[b]NEW VERSION!  1.12 released 20-August-2009[/b]

[img]http://rtw.apolyton.net/images/aod2.jpg[/img]

Welcome to the age of conquistadors, colonisation, puffy European Kings, Indian wars and buccaneers!

As an expansion to Civ4: Colonization the Age of Discovery II aims to enhance, add to and complete the game.

[b]Summary:[/b]
AoD2 hopes to take the C4C experience to new heights by adding new playable nations, complete with unique traits and units as well as introducing new strategic concepts to expand the game and take the player in multiple directions. A major focus has been to change the game's influence from small nations to large Empires (an initial fault in the release version of C4C is that it is easier to win with only two tiny colonies than with 20 large established colonies).

New victory conditions have been added, including Economic and Industrialisation victories. These victories are for players who wish to play a builder-style of game and concentrate on trade or infrastructure with their colonies.

New maps have been included. The Colonization I map is a direct copy of the original games map (with random natives, goods and ruins). The second map is the Columbus Dream map. What if Columbus was right? When you hold the Declaration of Independance, your flag will change from the European flag to a new flag (eg: from England to Betsy Ross). The PatchMod has also been added to eliminate bugs from the game, rebalance and expand certain core concepts.
